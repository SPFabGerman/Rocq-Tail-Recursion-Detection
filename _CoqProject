# We first load the definitions for fixpoint references and
./theories/FixpointReference.v

# tracking of fixpoint contexts.
./theories/ContextTracking.v

# Then we load the definitions of the detection algorithm.
./theories/TailRecursionDetection.v

# And finally we load the commands to use.
./theories/Commands.v

# Also, we have some examples
